    <h1 class="padding-50-new">Background</h1>
    <h3 class="padding-30">What is St. Michael’s Hospital?</h3>
    <p>St. Michael’s Hospital is a large teaching and research hospital, covering over 1.5 million square feet in the heart of downtown Toronto. Affectionately known as the Urban Angel, St. Michael’s is renowned for providing exceptional patient care and being one of Canada’s most prominent teaching hospitals and research centres. 

    <br><br> Despite being one of the oldest hospitals in Toronto, St. Michael’s heavily invests in staying up-to-date with everything healthcare, technology, and construction-related. As part of this, the Redevelopment team in the Planning Department works directly with physicians, engineering consultants, and architectural firms for all expansion and renovation projects. I was fortunate enough to be able to work as a Project Engineer Co-op with the Redevelopment team in the Fall term of 2019.   
        
    <br><br> Co-op students are always encouraged to seek and discover new initiatives that can be tackled and one of the ideas that I came up with was addressing the shortcomings of the incredibly crucial Palliative Care Unit. 
    </p>

    <h3 class="padding-30">What is Palliative Care?</h3>
    <p>The Palliative Care Unit (PCU) manages distressing symptoms such as pain, nausea, or difficulty breathing, and ensures comfort when a cure is no longer possible. To be admitted, patients and families must agree with a palliative plan of care, which means they have agreed to stop further active treatment, and a do not resuscitate status has been agreed upon. The patients typically have a life expectancy of three months or less, so this is a very sensitive unit. Hence, a Palliative Care Unit’s environment should be structured for the comfort of patients, and their families or friends. 

    <br><br> The PCU at St. Michael’s Hospital has only 10 beds, with 6 being in shared double rooms, and 4 being in private rooms. The PCU also offers a family lounge with a kitchen, dining area, library, quiet room, laundry facilities, and a patient shower. 
    </p>

    <h1 class="padding-50-new">
        Despite St. Michael’s Hospital actively improving patient experience throughout the hospital, there is currently no plan for improving the Palliative Care Unit space to satisfy the newest standards of patient care. 
    </h1>

    <h3 class="padding-30">The Opportunity</h3>
    <p>A typical palliative care patient’s setting of choice is their home, but if unavailable, the hospital should be a close second. The PCU is outdated and fails to accommodate all the needs and wants of a patient or their visitor. After the latest hospital renovation project, the fourth floor of the Donnelly Wing, which includes the PCU, will be the only floor that has not been renovated. 
        
    <br><br> The reason this project was conceptualized is that the PCU will have to be temporarily relocated to the Bond Wing sometime in 2020 for about half a year to completely redo the plumbing in the Donnelly Wing. The PCU would ,unfortunately, be temporarily relocating to a significantly older and slightly smaller area of the hospital that was vacant for the foreseeable future. The idea was to time any renovation work to fit within this mandatory but temporary relocation period. This would mean that we would welcome the patients back to a new and improved unit with minimal disruption to them and their families. 
    </p>

    <h3 class="padding-30">Current Plans</h3>
    <p>Just before my internship began, a donor committed to paying a generous $120,000 to refurnish the PCU and give it a nice refresh. However, I thought it would be a waste of resources to just renovate an aesthetic attribute of the PCU instead of taking advantage of the opportunity we were provided to make a substantial improvement to the patient experience as well. 
        
    <br><br>After bringing up the idea of possibly giving the PCU a more intensive revamp, the donor expressed interest in donating more money for the right plan. We had a prime opportunity in our hands, but we also needed to consider the constraints we were dealing with. 
    </p>

    <h3 class="padding-30">Constraints</h3>
    <h4>Time</h4>
    <p>Since this project was occurring during a co-op work term, I faced the ever-present constraint of time. Being confined to a four-month work term, I was determined to at least get the attention and interest of some executives so that the project had a fighting chance to live on after my term came to an end. 
    </p>

    <h4>Cost</h4>
    <p>The Canadian healthcare system is extremely valuable to Canadians and is very patient-centric. However, due to the nature of the public sector, hospitals do not receive as much funding as we would like them to. This means we are severely limited in our budget for projects that we know would benefit our patients, and we must rely on and seek the attention of philanthropists to donate and fund our projects.  
    </p>

    <h4>Physical Space</h4>
    <p>Due to the nature of being in the heart of downtown Toronto, there is physically no space that the hospital can expand to. The only way is up, but with the foundation of the building only being able to support a certain number of floors, we were completely boxed in. 
    </p>

    <h1 class="padding-50-new">Key Metrics</h1>
    <p>As with any well-executed project, before moving on, we first needed to establish key performance metrics that we’d be considering and measuring with our final solution.  
    </p>

    <h3 class="padding-30">Impact</h3>
    <p>Clearly, as a hospital, the most important metric to consider is impact, which can be divided into impact on the patient/visitor, and impact on hospital staff. 
    </p>

    <h4>Patient/Visitor</h4>
    <p>In regards to the impact on the patient and visitor, things that we take into consideration would be how big the room is, and the aesthetic of the unit. Also, the level of privacy. When two patients share a room and one passes away, this can create a very uncomfortable situation for the other patient and the deceased family. This conflicts with end-of-life best practices since death is a private family experience, similar to childbirth. Something else to consider would be the ease of access to the unit. Hopefully, the patient is getting visited frequently, and you would want the unit to be in a location that can be easily accessed from street level. 
    </p>

    <h4>Staff</h4>
    <p>For the staff, we would have to be mindful of the workflow. We have to keep in mind rooms dedicated to the staff, and the layout of the space so that nurses can complete their rounds conveniently.
    </p>

    <h3 class="padding-30">Longevity</h3>
    <p>For longevity, we would have to consider how long our solution can be in place. Questions we have to ask ourselves is does our solution have the ability to be iterated in the future? Would it need to be iterated? Would we need to conduct more moves, or disrupt the clinic more in the future? 
    </p>

    <h3 class="padding-30">Construction Feasibility</h3>
    <p>In terms of construction feasibility, there are lots of things to think about. Is there enough air? Do we need to be moving patients? Are we satisfying fire safety requirements? Do we have updated nurse call services? Is our plumbing fine? Is there asbestos in our walls and ceilings? How long would the construction take? There’s a limit to the work that can realistically be done in a space, especially for a sensitive unit in an already-sensitive hospital environment.  

    <br><br>At the end of the day, the PCU doesn’t need any state-of-the-art technology, breakthrough innovations, or the latest science. We just need a space that can provide patients with peace, quiet, and a sense of humanity in their last moments.

    <br><br>That being said, let’s get straight into the different alternatives. 
    </p>

    <h1 class="padding-50-new">Solutions</h1>
    <h3 class="padding-30">Not Relocating</h3>
    <p>
    The first option is to renovate the unit’s current space in the Donnelly Wing while the PCU temporarily relocates. This would allow us to make some changes to the space to meet some of the requests that have been made by the current clinical team, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Converting 2 double patient rooms into 4 private patient rooms
        </li>
        <li>The addition of a spare bed to add capacity for the flu season
        </li>
        <li>A touchdown space for physicians 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, if we measure it up against the performance metrics, this would involve some disturbance to the patients and families because it would involve moving the beds back and forth.

    <br><br>However, this final location in the Donnelly wing is a prime location for visitors, easily accessible from Queen street.

    <br><br>This would also allow for the unit to keep all the same amenities they had before such as the convenient nursing station location, the family lounge, staff lounge, quiet room, patient shower, and laundry. In fact, the renovation would allow for an opportunity to shift rooms around, such as moving the laundry room into the staff lounge so that the laundry room can become a physician touchdown space.

    <br><br>In terms of longevity, this would be a permanent measure, but I’ll get more into this later.

    <br><br>In terms of construction feasibility, the air would be fine since it was just upgraded. The plumbing will be renewed, and the new nurse call devices would be installed. We have done renovations in the Donnelly wing before, so we know generally what to look out for. When everyone clears out of Donnelly for the plumbing stack rework, this will make the construction feasibility go up since any above or below coordination is typically difficult because of the ambulatory ORs being directly above. We would also need to put in sprinklers, which we could request Health Infrastructural Renewal Fund (HIRF) money for, and while we’re up there we could use the money to redo the ceilings as well.

    <br><br>One concern would be the asbestos that is on the mastic duct insulation of the HVAC in the two double rooms when we put in the drywall and put in new intake and exhaust fans. But, we could use about 10k of the HIRF money to deal with this.

    <br><br>Judging from all of this, after getting an initial estimate from contractors, this work would cost approximately $1.5 - 2 million.
    </p>

    <h3 class="padding-30">Relocating Within the Hospital</h3>
    <p>A second option would be to immediately renovate the space in the Bond Wing that the PCU was going to be in temporarily, and let that be their new permanent home. This would be very beneficial from a Planning Department perspective, because this frees up prime real estate in Donnelly Wing as a swing space for future projects, or if another clinic desperately needs more space. This would work towards our vision of converting the Donnelly Wing to an ambulatory-only wing, but it would also work against our long-term goal of not having sleeping patients in the Bond Wing.

    <br><br>From a patient perspective, this would be less disruptive because it would only involve one move instead of two.

    <br><br>However, this inconveniences the visitors of the patients as the Bond Wing isn’t as accessible as the Donnelly Wing.

    <br><br>The space in the Bond Wing, while having 10 private patient rooms, has a smaller number of total rooms, which would mean the unit having to sacrifice some of the additional amenities they had before. This also changes the workflow of the clinical team since they would be in a new space with a different layout.

    <br><br>In terms of longevity, this would also be a shorter solution than the first option because the Bond wing is probably the next to go after Shuter comes down. It also doesn’t seem appealing to go from a 1960s building to a 1940s building.

    <br><br>This leads to my next point which is construction feasibility. 4 Bond definitely does not have enough air. While this wouldn’t really be a problem as a temporary measure, this would be a concern if we are looking into moving the unit into this space permanently. This would involve the installation of another air handling unit, which will cost millions of dollars, and would require space on the mechanical floors that we don’t really have.

    <br><br>We would need to change out a lot of things such as the heating coils for the radiant heating panels, and if we were to do work in the patient bathrooms, which we should, then we would have to deal with a lot of asbestos, which would also cost quite a lot of money.

    <br><br>We would need to install sprinklers, new nurse call devices which aren’t part of 3.0 scope, and we would need to do plumbing stack rework.

    <br><br>The floors above and below are admin staff, so doing the construction wouldn’t be a concern in that aspect.

    <br><br>So, from all this, we can gather that it would be a lot more expensive than option 1, and for an older wing that will likely come down after Shuter.
    </p>

    <h3 class="padding-30">Relocating to a New Hospital</h3>
    <p>
    The third and final option that I could see is downscaling the Palliative Care Unit at St. Mike’s, moving it over to 4 Bond with a smaller scope, and redirecting patients to Providence Healthcare. Similar to option 2, this would also free up space on Donnelly to use as swing space, or to potentially make room for another clinic.
        
    <br><br>From a patient and family perspective, this would be highly disruptive. Taking into consideration the nature of the unit, moving patients from one hospital to another would be very stressful, and would possibly kill the patients during transportation. The patients in St. Michael’s palliative, are most of the time, patients from another part of the hospital, and they all came to St. Mike’s for a reason.
        
    <br><br>You may be thinking, palliative patients are transported all the time in ambulances, so what’s the difference? In most cases, when palliative patients are transported, they are being sent so that they can die at home peacefully. Even if you consider the fact that you are transporting patients to another hospital so that we can ensure we are delivering the right level of care to patients who need it the most, the question I would propose is, why don’t we become the hospital that can deliver the right level of care?
        
    <br><br>In terms of longevity, this would be a permanent measure.
        
    <br><br>In terms of construction feasibility at St. Mike’s, this would involve the same work as option 2, but at a smaller scale since there are fewer patient rooms required. The other existing patient rooms could be converted to rooms of lower construction demand, such as offices, or quiet rooms, or multi-faith rooms. We would be using the same dollar, for less square footage.
        
    <br><br>In terms of construction feasibility at Providence, although Providence can house 37 patients, this would not be sustainable for the long run, and construction would be necessary. The first and second floors of their Palliative building is potential real estate. The second floor is being projected to become an outpatient clinic, where patients can receive services for symptom management and go back out into society. Services such as yoga, counselling, infusions, transfusions, IV. However, Providence can offer amenities that St. Michael’s simply doesn’t have space for, like a business center, or suites for visitors to sleep. 
    </p>

    <h1 class="padding-50-new">Making a Decision</h1>
    <p>Compiling all the considerations above into a weighted decision matrix, we can mathematically find the most objectively correct decision using subjective factors.  
    </p>

    <img src="images/matrix.png" alt="#" style="width:100%">

    <p>The recommendation I arrived at was to renovate 4 Donnelly. This would minimize disruption as much as possible, adhere to better patient care standards, and accommodate staff and visitors.

    <br><br>By doing this work, we can send a strong message about the sacredness of life by improving the quality of experience for patients and families. We are treating families, not just patients. The best place to do palliative care would be at home, but when that’s not an option, the hospital should be a close second.

    <br><br>We have the best doctors, staff, and technology, so we should have the facilities to match. The appearance of our facilities instills confidence and we would want people to feel comfortable during their most difficult time. 
    </p> 

    <h1 class="padding-50-new">Final Design</h1>
    <p>With all the measures we were taking to ensure we were building out the right solution also came the concern of scope creep. As mentioned before, we were timeboxed within the temporary relocation period, so we had to prioritize and finalize our work accordingly. Scope creep doesn’t necessarily only occur once construction begins. It can also occur in the design stage, so it was important for us to be mindful of tasks we were adding through frameworks such as the RICE scoring method.   

    <br><br>Now, when designing for the palliative care unit, as I mentioned in the problem statement, the space should feel like a home, and have amenities to accommodate all of a patient’s and their visitor’s needs. 

    <br><br>For the interest of patient safety and privacy, I won’t be sharing the real photos or the finalized floor plan, but I have included below some final renderings of the space.   
    </p>

    <img src="images/Interior-design-samples.PNG" alt="#" style="width:100%">
    <img src="images/interior-design.PNG" alt="#" style="width:100%">
    
    <h1 class="padding-50-new">Executive Buy-In</h1>
    <p>As with any company, once there’s an idea, we can’t simply start building it out. This is especially true for the public sector, where you need executive buy-in. So, I compiled a presentation with all my research and analysis above and presented my recommendation with justification to everyone in the Planning Department and a few executives near the end of my term.    

    <br><br>As I learned in my Product Management experience beforehand, doing a little bit of competitive analysis can always be useful. So, I reached out to several hospitals in the province that had recently revamped their PCUs and asked them for the data that they used to get buy-in for their projects and included these figures in my presentation as well. 
    
    <br><br>Overall, I was met with positive feedback, so I have high hopes that I was able to make a positive impact on patients for years to come. 
    </p> 
    
    <h1 class="padding-50-new">Conclusion and Reflections</h1>
    <p>
        I would like to gratefully acknowledge Thomas Parker and the Redevelopment team at St. Michael’s Hospital. Their support, mentorship, and unwavering kindness in every interaction made my term extremely enjoyable and showed me how pleasant it could be working in the healthcare industry. 

        <br><br>As a biomedical engineer, I was naturally drawn to the position of a Project Engineer at a hospital, and I could not have made a better choice at that point in my life. Coming into work every day was incredibly fulfilling as I got to see and interact with patients as I benefited them in the short-term and long-term. 

        <br><br>In four short months, I was fortunate enough to learn about and facilitate the intricate process behind keeping a hospital fully functional. I had the opportunity to take an idea, build it up to an actionable plan, and present it in front of executives who absolutely loved my data and passion.
